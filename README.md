# ðŸ“˜ Standard Solutions to Classic Problems

This repository contains **standard, well-explained solutions** to common coding problems.  
Unlike my experiments repo (where I try different approaches), this repo is dedicated to **clean, optimal, and accepted solutions** with clear explanations in **Markdown** for easy reference.

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- Each problem is documented in a **separate `.md` file**.
- Solutions are written in **Java** (for now).
- Each file contains:
    - Problem description
    - Naive approach (if useful for learning)
    - Optimal approach (with code)
    - Complexity analysis
    - Additional notes
